This repository includes a MIPS assembly implementation of the finite impulse response filter. The assembly code is based on a reference C program. It features two versions, one purely based on C and another optimized.

For more information please see the `Assignment.pdf` that describes the exercise and `Report.pdf` which explains the optimizations and analyses the benchmark improvements.

This project was done for TU Delft course: Modern Computer Architectures (ET4074).
